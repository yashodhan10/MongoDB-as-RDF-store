# MongoDB-as-RDF-store

This was designed for my class project. 

This project mainly focuses on how mongodb can be used as a RDF store. Being a document based database, mongodb uses different format to store graph data. 

Currently I'm working with only triples. RDF files can be .rdf,.nt. nq etc. 

For running code, load.py is the main file. In queries text file, I have given all the working queries and run it in the mongodb.
ed.nt file contains few sample triples to work with.
